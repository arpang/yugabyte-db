Run individual tests like

    pg15_tests/test_D29226.sh fastdebug --gcc11

Run a test n times like

    pg15_tests/run_test_n_times.sh pg15_tests/test_D29226.sh 10 debug --clang15

Run all tests once like

    pg15_tests/run_all_tests.sh fastdebug --clang16

Add tests by adding a new test file following the existing conventions.  Make
sure it passes 10x in a row to avoid introducing flaky tests, and make sure all
tests pass (at least once) to avoid regressions.  Note: these tests are not
covered by jenkins.

In the later stages of pg15, there will be no more need for these tests because
the underlying tests will pass.  For now, these tests are most useful to assert
parts of tests pass or that tests only fail due to known errors.  There are
still some tests here that assert underlying tests completely pass, and that's
useful in the early stage where most tests fail because it is hard to tell from
detective whether known-passing tests are still passing.

(When, in the future, deactivating these tests, don't forget to remove the line
in .arclint.)
